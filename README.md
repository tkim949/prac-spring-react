1. __To start, you need to run `npm install`.__


If this gives you something like to do `npm audit fix` but it is not working enough, you might need this.
  - `npm cache clean --force`
  - `npm update`
  - `npm intall`
  - `npm update` again!
  
  

2.  __This shows how to create your database and table.__

3.  __And this shows how to set your database name and server port.__

For this application, I chose `demo`.

__After this, you might still have some warning signs depending on your IDE, but it should be working regardless of those warning signs__
