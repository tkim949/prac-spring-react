This is to learn React Spring and Postgres for school group project.


I got the code from below Youtube lecture and its github code.

1. __To start, you need to run `npm install`.__


If this gives you something like to do `npm audit fix` but it is not working enough, you might need this.
  - `npm cache clean --force`
  - `npm update`
  - `npm intall`
  - `npm update` again!
  
  

2.  __This shows how to create your database and table.__

3.  __And this shows how to set your database name and server port.__

For this application, I chose `demo`.

But, I fixed some typos and syntax changes and also changed the port number from 8080 to 8082, which is because I need to use the port number 8080 for another project. ^^;;
